Student   StudentAddress
std_id		std_id
std_Name 	Foregin key of std_id of Student table

The One-to-One relationship requires some “extra” code because it has a special property of inheriting the foreign key from the parent table (Employee) and using it as the primary key of the child table (Address). To facilitate this property, we need to be sure that the primary key on the child table actually references the primary key of the parent table
