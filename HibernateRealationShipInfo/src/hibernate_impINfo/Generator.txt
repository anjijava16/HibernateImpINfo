org.hibernate.id.IdentifierGeneratar Interface

i) assigned
<!--  Default Generator -->
		<generator class="assigned"></generator>
		</id>

2)Increment ::
Hibernate: select max(EID) from EmployeeHb_Ge
Hibernate: insert into EmployeeHb_Ge (FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, EMAIL, EID) values (?, ?, ?, ?)

3)Sequence : Database Independt only work oracle not work in MYSQL
Hibernate: select hibernate_sequence.nextval from dual
Hibernate: insert into EmployeeHb_Ge (FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, EMAIL, EID) values (?, ?, ?, ?)

<generator>
<param name="sequence">MySequence</param>
</genetator>

Other wise::
If the programmer has not passed any sequence name, then hibernate creates its own sequence with name “Hibernate-Sequence” and gets next value from that sequence, and than assigns that id value for new record

NOTE :
But remember, if hibernate want’s to create its own sequence, in hibernate configuration file, hbm2ddl.auto property must be set enabled
create sequence MySequence incremented by 5;
first it will starts with 1 by default
though you send the primary key value., hibernate uses this sequence concept only
But if we not create any sequence, then first 1 and increments by 1..bla bla. in this case hibernate creating right..? so ensure we have hbm2ddl.auto enabled in the configuration file


4)Identity:: Work only mysql DB not work in Oracle DB
Hibernate: insert into EmployeeHb_Ge (FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, EMAIL) values (?, ?, ?)

5)native ::
Hibernate: insert into EmployeeHb_Ge (FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, EMAIL) values (?, ?, ?)

6)foregin

It is used for one -to -one relation time
